# Documentation Overhaul Plan

**Objective**: Create a complete, truthful, and updated set of documentation that perfectly matches the current "Fortified" codebase.

## User Review Required
> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Strict Phased Approach**: I will not proceed to the next stage until you approve the current one.
>
> **Stage 1: Requirements Definition (요건 정의서)**
> - Retrospective documentation of *what* the system currently does (Business Rules, Safeguards, Alerts).
> - **Deliverable**: `docs/REQUIREMENTS.md`
>
> **Stage 2: Product Requirements Document (PRD)**
> - The functional specification. How standard users, admin users, and the system interact.
> - **Deliverable**: `docs/PRD.md`
>
> **Stage 3: Technical Specifications (System Architecture)**
> - Detailed code structure, Database Schema, 4-Layer Defense explanation, File Tree.
> - **Deliverable**: `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`
>
> **Stage 4: Operational & Maintenance Guide**
> - How to monitor, debug, and fix. "Dead Man's Switch" manual.
> - **Deliverable**: `docs/OPERATIONS.md`

## Proposed Changes
- Create `docs/` folder (it was missing).
- Create 4 new markdown files sequentially.
- Update [README.md](file:///d:/Project/05_regulation_news/README.md) to index these new documents.
- Update [task.md](file:///C:/Users/orbzo/.gemini/antigravity/brain/22cb1216-058b-457d-b61c-210ee06d4342/task.md) to reflect the completion of the stabilization project.

## Verification
- User reviews `REQUIREMENTS.md` to confirm it covers all verbally discussed rules (Score 5 for Personnel, KST usage, etc.).
